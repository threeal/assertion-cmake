# Assertion.cmake

A [CMake](https://cmake.org/) module containing a collection of assertion
functions and other utilities for testing CMake code.

The main feature of this module is the `assert` function, which asserts the
given condition in the style of CMake's
[`if`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/if.html) function. If the
assertion fails, it throws a fatal error message with information about the
context of the asserted condition.

This module also supports
[CMake test](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Testing%20With%20CMake%20and%20CTest.html)
creation using the `assertion_add_test` function. This function creates a new
test that processes the given file in script mode with variables, functions, and
macros from this module available in the test file.

If this module is processed in script mode, it can optionally include other
modules by passing their paths as additional arguments after `--`.

## Key Features

- Contains a collection of assertion functions for testing purposes.
- Supports asserting fatal error messages.
- Supports asserting process execution.
- Supports separating tests into sections.

## Integration

This module can be integrated into a CMake project in the following ways:

- Manually download the [`Assertion.cmake`](./cmake/Assertion.cmake) file and include it in the CMake project:
  ```cmake
  include(path/to/Assertion.cmake)
  ```
- Use [`file(DOWNLOAD)`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/file.html#download) to automatically download the `Assertion.cmake` file:
  ```cmake
  file(
    DOWNLOAD https://github.com/threeal/assertion-cmake/releases/download/v0.3.0/Assertion.cmake
      ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Assertion.cmake
    EXPECTED_MD5 851f49c10934d715df5d0b59c8b8c72a)
  include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Assertion.cmake)
  ```
- Use [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) to add this package to the CMake project:
  ```cmake
  cpmaddpackage(gh:threeal/assertion-cmake@0.3.0)
  ```

## API Reference

### `ASSERTION_LIST_FILE`

This variable contains the path to the included `Assertion.cmake` module.

### `assertion_add_test`

Adds a new test that processes the given CMake file in script mode.

```cmake
assertion_add_test(<file> [NAME <name>])
```

This function adds a new test that processes the given `<file>` in script mode.
If `NAME` is specified, it will use `<name>` as the test name; otherwise, it
will use `<file>`.

Internally, the test will process the `Assertion.cmake` module in script mode
and include the given `<file>` at the end of the module, allowing variables,
functions, and macros in the `Assertion.cmake` module to be available in the
`<file>` without the need to include the `Assertion.cmake` module from the
`<file>`.

#### Example

```cmake
assertion_add_test(test/first_test.cmake)

assertion_add_test(test/second_test.cmake NAME "Second Test")
```

The above example adds two new tests. The first one is named
`test/first_test.cmake`, which will process the file with the same name as the
test. The second one is named `Second Test`, which will process the
`test/second_test.cmake` file.

### `fail`

Throws a formatted fatal error message.

```cmake
fail(<lines>...)
```

This macro throws a fatal error message formatted from the given `<lines>`.

It formats the message by concatenating all the lines into a single message. If
one of the lines is a variable, it will be expanded and indented by two spaces
before being concatenated with the other lines.

#### Example

```cmake
set(COMMAND "some_command arg0 arg1 arg2")
set(REASON "some reason")

fail("something happened when executing" COMMAND "because of" REASON)
```

The above example throws a fatal error message formatted as follows:

```
something happened when executing:
  some_command arg0 arg1 arg2
because of:
  some reason
```

### `assert`

Asserts the given condition.

```cmake
assert(<condition>...)
```

This function performs an assertion on the given `<condition>`. If the assertion
fails, it will output a formatted fatal error message with information about the
context of the asserted condition.

Refer to the documentation of CMake's
[`if`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/if.html) function for more
information about supported conditions for the assertion.

#### Example

```cmake
assert(DEFINED EXECUTABLE_PATH)
assert(IS_EXECUTABLE "${EXECUTABLE_PATH}")
```

The above example asserts whether the `EXECUTABLE_PATH` variable is defined and
resolves to the path of an executable. If the variable is not defined, it will
throw the following fatal error message:

```
expected variable:
  EXECUTABLE_PATH
to be defined
```

### `assert_fatal_error`

Asserts whether a command call throws a fatal error message.

```cmake
assert_fatal_error(CALL <command> [<arguments>...] MESSAGE <message>...)
```

This function asserts whether a function or macro named `<command>`, called with
the specified `<arguments>`, throws a fatal error message that matches the
expected `<message>`.

If more than one `<message>` string is given, they are concatenated into a
single message with no separator between the strings.

#### Example

```cmake
function(throw_fatal_error MESSAGE)
  message(FATAL_ERROR "${MESSAGE}")
endfunction()

assert_fatal_error(
  CALL throw_fatal_error "some message"
  MESSAGE "some message")
```

The above example asserts whether the call to
`throw_fatal_error("some message")` throws a fatal error message that matches
`some message`. If it somehow does not capture any fatal error message, it will
throw the following fatal error message:

```
expected to receive a fatal error message that matches:
  some message
```

### `assert_execute_process`

Asserts whether the given command correctly executes a process.

```cmake
assert_execute_process(
  [COMMAND] <command> [<arguments>...]
  [OUTPUT <output>...]
  [ERROR <error>...])
```

This function asserts whether the given `<command>` and `<arguments>`
successfully execute a process. If `ERROR` is specified, it instead asserts
whether it fails to execute the process.

If `OUTPUT` is specified, it also asserts whether the output of the executed
process matches the expected `<output>`. If more than one `<output>` string is
given, they are concatenated into a single output with no separator between the
strings.

If `ERROR` is specified, it also asserts whether the error of the executed
process matches the expected `<error>`. If more than one `<error>` string is
given, they are concatenated into a single error with no separator between the
strings.

#### Example

```cmake
assert_execute_process(
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo hello
  OUTPUT hello)
```

The above example asserts whether the call to `${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo hello`
successfully executes a process whose output matches `hello`. If it somehow
fails to execute the process, it will throw the following fatal error message:

```
expected command:
  ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo hello
not to fail with error:
  unknown error
```

### `section`

Begins a new test section.

```cmake
section(<name>...)
```

This function begins a new test section named `<name>`. It prints the test
section name and indents all subsequent messages by two spaces.

If more than one `<name>` string is given, they are concatenated into a single
name with no separator between the strings.

Use the `endsection` function to end the test section.

#### Example

```cmake
section("test something")
  section("it should not fail")
    message(STATUS "nothing happened")
  endsection()

  section("it should fail" " because something might happen")
    fail("something happened")
  endsection()
endsection()
```

The above example begins several test sections. If processed, it will output the
following lines:

```
-- test something
--   it should not fail
--     nothing happened
--   it should fail because something might happen
CMake Error (message):
  something happened
```

### `endsection`

Ends the current test section.

```cmake
endsection()
```

This function ends the current test section.
